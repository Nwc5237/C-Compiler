README FILE:

TODO:
-Shift operators <<, >>, and the other assignment operators
like <<=, >>=, ^=, |= , &= (and others I can't think of right
now if I'm forgetting them)

-Add in the e notation for floats

-Write a better makefile with options like make clean and whatever
else. As the project gets bigger it will be nice to have

-Make sure the *.h files are doing everything you want them to do

DONE:
-Make a state machine for the assignment operators (+=, /=, %=, etc)
and the math operators (+, -, *, /, %)

-bitwise and logical operators (&&, ||, &, |, ^, !, ~)
